# Super-Knight-Tales

### Introduction:
Super Knight Tales is a 2D pixel art game where the player controls a small knight adventurer through a perilous journey trying to find a cure for his condition. The player starts with just 1 minute to live, but as they progress, they can find upgrades and pieces of the cure that allows them to live longer.

### Target Population:
With the game having low graphics and no gore, it would be appropriate for all ages. This game is meant to appeal to those who like to grind/farm experience and use it to level up and get upgrades. 

### Purpose to the consumer:
Super Knight Tales has only one purpose, to entertain its users. People who enjoy experience farming and metroidvania type combat will find this game to be a fun little pastime. The simplicity and rapidness to get started will make it great for mobile gaming.
There are some games already out there that have simple gameplay with experience farming, like Vampire Survivors. What makes Super Knight Tales unique though is the constraint proposed by the curse timer that will kill the player once it runs out.

### Constraints: 
Possible bugs:
Player/enemy moves around after death.
The game will accept player inputs while paused.
The game wonâ€™t save the players progress.
Fortunately Unity uses C# scripts to manage a lot of the in game logic, so that means I can code in the functions that disable player inputs and enemy movements. The save files will be created locally so that it will be easy to make backups and copies just in case.

### Conclusion: 
I think this would be a great game for a gamejam or for a mobile device. I will start by making the game function on Windows, then WebGL and then android and possibly iOS. That way it can reach as many players as possible. I will mainly use free assets from the asset store and some self created ones as well.
